      description:
        "As a vital member of a dynamic 4-person team, I actively collaborated in the conception, design, and development of a cutting-edge voice-activated bike turn signal device, revolutionizing how cyclists communicate their turns with ease. Leveraging Edge Impulse and harnessing audio samples sourced from Google Speech Commands, we successfully crafted a sophisticated machine learning model (MLM) that exhibited remarkable accuracy in detecting voice commands for both left and right turns. Demonstrating our technical prowess, we seamlessly integrated this MLM onto an Arduino Nano 33 BLE board and executed real-time voice command processing using C++. This seamless functionality triggered LED lights, ingeniously providing cyclists with clear, intuitive visual cues while ensuring the safety of both the user and surrounding individuals. Our achievement not only elevated the biking experience but also exemplified the power of innovation and teamwork in pushing the boundaries of modern cycling technology.",
